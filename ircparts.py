		__init__ 

		<self._parse_message()> operates on a message object. returns a tuple with all the message categories. OPTIONALLY: sets the attributes of the object according to the parse
		<self._make_message()> does the opposite of parse message - it takes in a bunch of tokens and outputs a valid IRC message. The types of messages it would send include:
			1. error messages 2. confirmation-of-action-request messages (when requesting exit, nick change, etc.) 3. notifications from the server (welcome, goodbye) 4. PRIVMSGs being relayed
			OPTIONALLY : 5. responses to information requests (users, WHOIS, etc.)

		- Prefix (Optional)
		- Command
		- Command Parameters
